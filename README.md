# Usage

I only tested on Chrome on Windows. To use (you'll need to install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) for Chrome or [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for Firefox, first):

1. Install the script ([link](https://github.com/JC3/F1TVBigPlayer/raw/main/F1TVBigPlayer.user.js)).
2. Go to the F1TV video you want to watch, as normal.
3. At the bottom right of the player there is now a new button that is just the outline of a rectangle.
4. Press that button to toggle between large and default size.

That's it. Feel free to report issues on issue page or make PR fixes.
