# Usage

Since I cranked this out in desparation like 5 seconds before the Saudi Arabia start time, it doesn't have any GUI to speak of, so you'll still need the console for now. Also I only tested on Chrome on Windows.

1. Install the script.
2. Go to the F1TV video you want to watch and wait for it to start.
3. Open the console.
4. Type `MakeFullWidth()` to make the player take the whole browser window.
5. Type `MakeDefaultWidth()` to restore it to its default size.

That's it. Button coming soon. Feel free to report issues on issue page or make PR fixes.
